# Threaded-Subdomain-Enumerator
The tool is designed for speed, stability, and clarity, combining multithreading, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, SOC-style colored output, and structured logging. Unlike basic scanners, this project provides real-time visibility into scanning progress while maintaining a clean log of discovered subdomains.
